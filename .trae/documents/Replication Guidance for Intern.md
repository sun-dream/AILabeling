The task is to guide an intern to replicate a webpage based on `origin.html`. I have analyzed the provided `origin.html`, `instruction.md`, and the intern's codebase in `testbed`.

**Key Actions Taken:**
1.  **Codebase Analysis**:
    -   Read `origin.html` to extract image URLs and structure.
    -   Read `instruction.md` for specific requirements and image mappings.
    -   Examined `testbed` code (`App.jsx`, `Hero.jsx`, etc.) to identify gaps (missing images, missing navigation, flat design).
2.  **Feedback Generation**:
    -   Created `build.md` following the specific format requested (Overall -> HTML -> CSS -> JS).
    -   Provided detailed instructions on replacing CSS shapes with specific image URLs found in the source.
    -   Instructed on adding the missing Navigation bar and Sponsor logos.
    -   Added the requirement for all clickable elements to open `https://www.example.com`.

**Outcome:**
-   `e:\lcy\codeing\AILabeling\7587077102281821979\build.md` has been created with the required feedback in Chinese.
