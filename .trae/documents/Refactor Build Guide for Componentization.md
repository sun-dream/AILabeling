I have successfully refactored `build.md` to provide a clear componentization strategy and detailed implementation guide. The new guide includes:

1.  **Componentization Strategy**:
    -   Proposed a structured directory layout (`src/components/common`, `sections`, `ui`).
    -   Defined core reusable components: `SectionDivider`, `EventCard`, `DraggablePaper`, `Navbar`, `Marquee`.

2.  **Visual & Assets Mapping**:
    -   Detailed the image resources for Hero papers, Section Dividers, Event Cards, and Footer Sponsors.
    -   Provided specific URL patterns and examples.

3.  **Missing Features**:
    -   Added requirements for the missing `Navbar` (including background texture).
    -   Defined the global click interaction rule (open `https://www.example.com`).

4.  **CSS Polish**:
    -   Reminded about font configuration and global paper texture background.

The `build.md` file is now ready for the intern to use as a comprehensive guide for refactoring and completing the website.
