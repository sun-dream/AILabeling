I have updated `build.md` with the comprehensive image resource list as requested.

**Key Updates:**
1.  **Expanded "Cards Data" Section**:
    -   Provided a full table for **Lectures**, including background and foreground image URLs for *Organizirano Oblikovanje*, *Ivan Veljača*, *high on type*, and *Matej Merlić & Maja Merlić Ilić*.
    -   Provided a full table for **Workshops**, including *Klasja Habjan*, *Büro Bietenhader Moroder*, *Appear Offline*, and *Emil Flatz & Luka Perić*.
2.  **Expanded "Footer Sponsors" Section**:
    -   Listed all 17 sponsor logo URLs in the correct order, ready for the intern to copy and paste.

The `build.md` document now serves as a complete reference for both component structure and asset implementation, removing the need for the intern to consult `origin.html` directly.
